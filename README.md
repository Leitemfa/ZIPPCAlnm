Zero-Inflated Probabilistic PCA framework with logistical normal multinomial distribution (ZIPPCA-LNM), that extends probabilistic PCA from the Gaussian setting to multivariate abundance data, and an empirical Bayes approach was proposed for inferring microbial compositions. An efficient VA algorithm, classification VA, has been developed for fitting this model.
